    "pymez is a python package born out of the daily needs of a laboratory scientist. In particular, there is a constant need to use external equipment to acquire data, store that data in a sensible way, analyze the stored data, and generate collections and reports after analyzing the data. In the world of scientific computation there is an endless universe of solutions to do this, however none of the solutions met my personal daily needs and philosophy simultaneously. This package tries to stitch together many tools to meet those needs, while serving as a backend library to a webserver. It thus has a lot of other packages. It relies on these packages in different ways and may operate differently on different oeprating systems.Although it currently has a single primary developer, it is my hope that it will be adopted by at least 10's of people and help them accomplish their daily scientific goals."

    "### Overall Design Goal\n",
    "pymez was designed with the overal goal of being easy to use, well documented, well tested and modular. The overall design follows a pattern of Models (DataHandlers), View and View-Controllers (FrontEnds), Anaylsis and Instrument Control. The python modules that compose pymez follow these <a href=\"./Examples/jupyter/pymez_Module_Specification.ipynb\">jupyter version of the guidelines</a> or <a href=\"./Examples/html/pymez_Module_Specification.html\">html version of the guidelines</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Directory Structure\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> pymez : The top directory that should be installed in python27/Lib/site-packages or C:\\ProgramData\\Anaconda2\\Lib\\site-packages\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Code: The top level folder for the code repository </li>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Utils: Subpackage for utility functions needed by all of pymez</li>\n",
    "<li>DataHandlers: Data models needed by everything but Utils</li>\n",
    "<li>Analysis: Functions and classes based on analyzing data. Requires Utils and DataHandlers.</li>\n",
    "<li>InstrumentControl: Functions and classes that communicate with external devices. Requires Utils and DataHandlers</li>\n",
    "<li>FrontEnds: Functions and classes that tie it altogether for the user, requires all other modules.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<li> Documentation: Top level folder for docs including examples </li>\n",
    "<li> Instruments: A repository for XML sheets describing instruments </li>\n",
    "<li> Data: A repository for data, this is volatile and likely to change </li> \n",
    "<ul> \n",
    "<li>Measurements: Storage for measurement data, either in xml or ascii</li>\n",
    "<li>Logs: Storage for xml logs</li>\n",
    "<li>States: Storage for Instrument and Experimental States</li>\n",
    "<li>Reports: Storage for formatted output </li>\n",

    "</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing Infrastructure\n",
    "pymez has a multi-tiered testing infrastructure. It is comprised of basic unit tests, mesoscopic in-module tests, and integration tests. \n",
    "1. __Unit tests :__ These tests check if functions and classes with a basic input return what is expected. They are found in the module <a href=\"./pymez/Code/Utils/pymezUnitTest.m.html\">pymez.Code.Utils.pymezUnitTests</a> \n",
    "2. __In Module Tests :__ Theses tests are scripts included in each module that test a series of things about functions or classes, they are typically named test_thing_of_interest(). For example in the module pymez.Code.DataHandlers.XMLModels there are >15 scripts to test functions and classes with names like <a href=\"./pymez/Code/DataHandlers/XMLModels.m.html#pymez.Code.DataHandlers.XMLModels.test_get_header\">test_get_header</a>.\n",
    "3. __Integration Tests:__ These tests check if a large number of interacting components work as expected. For the wx frontend this is primarily the class <a href=\"./pymez/Code/FrontEnds/AdvancedInterfaceFrame.m.html\"> AdvancedInterfaceFrame</a>, or an integrated application that can open new window panels, run the in module tests and check if data objects appear as they are expected. For the django FrontEnd this is a Test_Server run using Django's development server found in manage.py. For Jupyter, this is a series of <a href=\"./Examples/jupyter/Examples_Home.ipynb\">examples</a> that live in pymez/Documentation/Examples. \n",
